Prokudin-Gorsky Plate Registration & Color Channel Assignment

This is an implementation and demonstration of registration by maximization of
mutual information. This computer vision algorithm achieves registration across
broad categories of imaging data and is particularly useful for medical imaging
and sensor fusion (the combination of different modalities of sensor data, such
as ultrasound and magnetic resonance). It is more robust than correlation
because it depends on the distribution of image values over the values
themselves.

The following paper is an excellent explanation of the technique:

This technique is demonstrated on an input of historical note for photography,
the color plates of Prokudin-Gorsky.

Prokudin-Gorsky traveled Russia with the blessing of the Tsar to capture the
country by color photography before color photography existed. No effective
devices had been developed for taking or display color photos at the time, but
he prepared for these innovations by capturing series of pictures with different
color filters. His plates were later combined to yield the earliest color photos
after the fact.

This project takes misaligned prokudin-gorsky plates, registers them over
translations by maximization of mutual information, and assigns each plate to a
color channel by analyzing the KL-divergence of color distributions for
different plate assignments and a training set of prokudin-gorsky photos.

I developed this project in Professor Learned-Miller's graduate computer vision
class.
