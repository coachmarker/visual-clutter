Evan Shelhamer's Visual Clutter

My visual side projects to complement whatever is kicking around my school
due to computer science and psychology studies, computer vision and cognitive
psychology laboratory work, or my idle curiosity.

If it’s a computer vision algo, a visual illusion, or anything else
appropriately filed under “Vision” I’ll include it here.

Congealing: MATLAB implementation of a computer vision algorithm for joint
alignment of a set of images. Alignment of handwritten digits is demonstrated
and results are discussed. Algorithm invented by Erik Learned-Miller.

Prokudin-Gorsky Registration: automatic creation of color photographs from
separate color plates of historical interest. Prokudin-Gorsky took series of
exposures on different plates with red, green, and blue filters to capture color
photography across Russia before there ever was such a thing as color
photography. Photos are created through registration of the plates by
maximization of mutual information and colors are selected by minimum
KL-divergence from a color distribution estimated on a training set.

Café Wall Illusion (CafeWall): Processing.org sketch for the Café Wall
geometric optical illusion. Parallel lines on a checkerboard appear slanted
due to displacements among rows.
