# Congealing Binary Digits

## The Congealing Algorithm

Congealing is a computer vision method for the joint alignment of images
developed by Erik Learned-Miller. In this particular instance it is used to
align images of handwritten 3s and 5s from the MNIST digits data set.

More information on congealing is available at Professor Learned-Millerâ€™s
[Congealing page](http://www.cs.umass.edu/~elm/congealing/).

## Implementation Notes

Input:
I "binarized" the images in digits.mat so that all values in the images are
from {0,1}. Makes calculation of stack probabilities trivial.

Optimization:
At each step, the sum of stack entropies minimizing single parameter
transformation for each image is selected. That is, only one paramter per image
is changed per iteration. The process ends when no transformation to any image
improves (decreases) the sum of stack entropies.

Parameter drift is prevented by re-centering each paramter s.t. it has
zero mean.

Parameter Deltas: more-or-less picked out of a hat, with a dash of
intuition and past experience.

Transformation: a backward mapping of image pixels is made by
1.composing single parameter transformation matrices into an affine matrix
2.taking its inverse for a backward, rather than forward mapping
3.preceding the backward transformation with a transformation to the origin,
  and following it with a transformation from the origin (to make rotation
  and other transformations behave properly)
4.filling in transformed pixels with their corresponding values from the
  source image (w/ nearest neighbor interpolation)
5.leaving a pixel off if it is mapped out-of-bounds in the source image

Smoothing: a "grey" image is appended to the digit stack so that there is
partial on & off at each pixel location, avoiding lock-in to certain
transformations.

## Results

Test Threes:  sum of stack entropies 2850.7 -> 2026.6 in 30 iterations
Train Threes: sum of stack entropies 2829.6 -> 1968.7 in 29 iterations
Test Fives:   sum of stack entropies 2952.7 -> 2053.0 in 41 iterations
Train Fives:  sum of stack entropies 2997.4 -> 2207.5 in 35 iterations

Inspection of mean images of original digits and congealed digits shows that
the congealed stack is more coherent, in that on pixels are more concentrated
down the stacks resulting in higher mean image values and concentration.

Refer to the figures/ dir to see the before/after mean images for the four
sets of digits (results are saved as PNG images).

## Discussion

In each case congealing was able to reduce the total entropy of the image
stacks, producing a more coherent mean image for the stacks. However, there are
still outlying transformations that can be seen as clouds surrounding the digit
on inspection. These could perhaps be reduced by a different choice of
parameters or more exhaustive search strategy than single step coordinate
descent.

It is possible that "thickening" the stack by cloning imaages subject to
random (small) affine transformations could smooth the coordinate descent
landscape s.t. a lower minimum entropy is achieved for the stack (= a better
joint alignment).

Runtime could be optimized by
1.estimating the pixel stack entropies by RADICAL (vasicek-derived estimation)
  or otherwise
2.calculating the backward transformation directly, rather than
  composing the forward affine transformation and inverting it.
