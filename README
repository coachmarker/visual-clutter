Evan Shelhamer's Visual Clutter

My visual side projects to complement whatever is kicking around my school
due to computer science and psychology studies, computer vision and cognitive
psychology laboratory work, or my idle curiosity.

If it’s a computer vision algo, a visual illusion, or anything else
appropriately filed under “Vision” I’ll include it here.

geometric optical illusion. Parallel lines on a checkerboard appear slanted
due to displacements among rows.
