# Prokudin-Gorksi Photo Plate Registration

## Results

Alignments were evaluated for each set of plates for 2, 16, 64, and 256 bins.

pass: 2, 16, 64, 256
fail:

all alignments ate identical and appear to be correct.

Image 00153
pass: 16, 64, 256
fail: 2

2 is awful.
the other three are identical and appear to be correct.

pass: 16, 64, 256
fail: 2

2 is jarring and shows "color shadows" on the houses.
The other results are identical and appear to be correct.

fail:

all alignments are identical and appear to be correct.

Image 00398
pass: 16, 64, 256
fail: 2

2 is out of alignment, but improved from original result.
16, 64, and 256 are identical and appear to be correct.

pass: 16, 64, 256
fail: 2

16, 64, and 256 are identical and appear to be perfect.
2 is -2, -1 (x, y) in the red plate.

pass: 16, 64
fail: 2, 256

16 & 64 appear to be correct and are identical.
2 is quite bad, and is especially off in the green channel.
256 is one horizontal pixel off on the green plate, but farther off the
mark on the red plate.

## Color Mapping:

The plates are ordered blue, green, red.

This was determined by finding the mapping of plates with minimum KL Divergence
w.r.t. an estimated color distribution for other (aligned) prokudin-gorski.

I ran it on a couple of images and took a majority vote. I expect
that this procedure would have chosen the correct mapping in all cases
if I were to crop the test images (those provided to be aligned)

## Discussion

Registration by maximization of mutual information is able to align each color
plate by grid search such that they look like a regular photograph
when combined, provided that a suitable number of bins is chosen. Too few bins
can lead to an oversimplified joint distribution without enough discrimination;
too many bins lead to more uniform distribution with less information. However,
the method works well overall and seems fairly robust to changes in binning.

b = 16, b = 64 seem to be reasonable for this application as both achieved the
correct alignment in each case.

I am surprised that reducing the color channels to binary values (b = 2)
worked in several cases. I interpret this to mean that although color channels
of the same photograph (or from a close series of photographs) may vary greatly
in values, they are highly statistically dependent. Given that they are all
photographs of the same object in the visible spectrum, I suppose I could be
less surprised, but working with two bins still impresses me.

That 256 bins led to failure in one case was expected. As more values are
considered, the co-occurence of any two values across images will tend to
drop, and estimates will be more uniform and less informative.

I am interested in evaluating how the number of bins affects registration
done by gradient/coordinate descent, rather than exhaustive search. I expect
that the lower bound on the number of bins needed to achieve a good alignment
would increase to provide smoothness.
